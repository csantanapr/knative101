## Clone the Lab Repo & Provide Container Registry Credentials

### Clone the lab repo
The application for this lab is a simple node.js with express app which returns the first n numbers of the Fibonacci sequence. To use the app, host it, and simply make a POST request to the `/fib` endpoint with the JSON data: `{"number":10}`

1. Clone the git repository:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/beemarie/fib-knative.git
    ```
2. Change directories to the fib-knative folder.

    ```
    cd fib-knative
    ```

### Set up a Private Container Registry and Obtain Credentials
In this lab, we'll use the [IBM Container Registry](https://console.bluemix.net/docs/services/Registry/registry_overview.html#registry_overview) to host our container images since you already have access to this through your IBM Cloud Account. IBM Container Registry enables you to store and distribute container images in a fully managed private registry.

1. Install the container registry plugin:

    ```
    ibmcloud plugin install container-registry
    ```
2. Add a namespace to your account. You must set at least one namespace to store images in IBM Cloud Container Registry. Choose a unique name for your first namespace. A namespace is a collection of related repositories (which in turn are made up of individual images). You can set up multiple namespaces as well as control access to your namespaces by using IAM policies.

    ```
    ibmcloud cr namespace-add <my_namespace>
    ```
3. Create a token. This token is a non-expiring token with read and write access to all namespaces in the region. The automated build processes you'll be setting up will use this token to access your images.

    ```
    ibmcloud cr token-add --description "knative read write token for all namespaces" --non-expiring --readwrite
    ```

4. The CLI output should include a Token Identifier and the Token. Make note of the Token for later in this lab. You will not need the Token Identifier. You can verify that the token was created by listing all tokens.

    ```
    ibmcloud cr token-list | grep knative
    ```

### Provide Container Registry Credentials
This lab will need credentials for authenticating to your private container registry. First, we'll need to create a `Secret` to store the credentials for this registry. This secret will be used for the knative-serving component to pull down an image from the container registry.

A `Secret` is a Kubernetes object containing sensitive data such as a password, a token, or a key. You can also read more about [Secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).

1. Let's create a secret, which will be a `docker-registry` type secret. This type of secret is used to authenticate with a container registry to pull down a private image. We can create this via the commandline. For username, simply use the string `token`. For <token_value>, use the token you made note of earlier.

    ```
    kubectl create secret docker-registry ibm-cr-secret --docker-server=https://registry.ng.bluemix.net --docker-username=token --docker-password=<token_value>
    ```

2. We will also need a secret for the kaniko build template to be able to push the built image to the container registry. To create this object, we'll first need to base64 encode our username and password for IBM Container Registry. For username, you will again use the string `token`. The base64 encoding of `token` should be: `dG9rZW4=` - which is already in the yaml file.  For token_value, again use the token you made note of earlier.

    ```
    echo -n "<token_value>" | base64 -w0  # Linux
    echo -n "<token_value>" | base64 -b0  # MacOS
    ```

2. This time we'll create the secret via a .yaml file. Update the `docker-secret.yaml` file with your base64 encoded password. You can find the password field near the end of the file. Username (`dG9rZW4=`) is already provided for you.

3. Apply the secret to your cluster:

    ```
    kubectl apply --filename docker-secret.yaml
    ```

    View the yaml used to create the Secret:
    ```
    kubectl get secret basic-user-pass -o yaml
    ```

    Example output:

    ```yaml
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Secret
    metadata:
      name: basic-user-pass
      annotations:
        build.knative.dev/docker-0: registry.ng.bluemix.net
    type: kubernetes.io/basic-auth
    data:
      # Use 'echo -n "username" | base64' to generate this string
      username: your_base_64_username
      # Use 'echo -n "password" | base64' to generate this string
      password: your_base_64_password
    ```

A `Service Account` provides an identity for processes that run in a Pod. This Service Account will be used to link the build process for Knative to the Secrets you just created.

4. Apply the service account to your cluster:

    ```
    kubectl apply --filename service-account.yaml
    ```

    View the yaml file used to create the Service Account:
    ```
    kubectl get serviceaccount build-bot -o yaml
    ```

    Example output:
    ```yaml
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: ServiceAccount
     metadata:
       name: build-bot
     secrets:
     - name: basic-user-pass
     imagePullSecrets:
     - name: ibm-cr-secret
    ```


Congratulations! You've set up some required credentials for the Knative build process to have access to push to your container registry. In the next exercise, you will build & deploy this app. The goal of this exercise was to set up the credentials for your app.
